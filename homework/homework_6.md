## Part 1 - Refactor the existing code

We now know enough to make the communication with the bot much nicer. Using while loops and functions, we can refactor the code we have so far.

The starting code makes the bot display a number of options. After we select an option, we can call a function that implements that action.


Copy the code you have into different functions. Ask yourself the following:

- [] What should this function do?
- [] What parameters does this function need?
- [] What does this function return?
- [] Is there something that you need to remove from your code to make it work?

Refactor the following functionalities into separate functions:

- [] Sally greets the user (hw 3)
- [] Sally guesses your number (hw 3)
- [] Sally sings a song  (hw 4)
- [] Sally makes you guess a number  (hw 4)
- [] Sally does statistics on an array of numbers (hw 5)
