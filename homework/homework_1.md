1. The Multiplication Operator

Starting with the following code, include the price of breakfast in the calculation of the estimated cost:

```
hostelPerNight = 20;
tripDuration = 5;

accomodationCost = hostelPerNight * tripDuration;
console.log(accomodationCost);
```

a. Create a variable to store the price of one breakfast

b. Use * and + to calculate the total cost

c. Print the accomodation cost including the breakfast cost



2. You are given as input the following 2 variables:
```
    gasPricePerLiter = 1.5;
    consumption = 8; // 8 liters for 100 km
```

a. Define one new variable to store the number of kilometers to your destination (e.g. ```kmDistance = 300```)

b. Calculate the total price for gas;

c. Define one new variable to store the price of a train ticket.

d. Calculate and print the price per kilometer when going by car.

e. Calculate and print the price per kilometer when going by train.


3. Start with two numerical values as input. Use the if statement to print only the strictly larger value.

    `Example Variables: a = 15; b = 20`

    `Print: 20`

4. Start with two numerical values as input. Write a program that swaps their values.

    `Example Variables: a = 15; b = 20`

    `Printing a: 20`
    `Printing b: 15`

5. Start with three numerical values. Use the if statement to print only the strictly larger value.

    `Example Variables: a = 15; b = 20; c = 25`

    `Print: 25`
